            <h4>Sound Design</h4>
            <p>Using Analog synths and outboard gear Dossas loves to create unique, one-of-a-kind sounds and effects. There are a lot of sampling possibilities too within the software world so he likes to resample clips and design his own VST’s. Using sampler VST’s in Ableton Live as well as Native Instrument’s Kontakt Player, he can take this technique to a whole other world. Using unique sounds as an instrument and process that audio via analog gear to add unique warmth and saturation, reverb and delay effects as well never heard before ambient soundscapes that loop on and on forever.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Modular Synth: Moog Grandmother (Mono Modular Synth that has an input ch.) so Dossas can re-amp through it using the modules such as the analog spring reverb, the modulator and the filters.</li>
              <li>FX Pedals: Hologram Microcosm Pedal & Strymon Timeline / Big Sky / El Capistan / Deco Pedals.</li>
              <li>Tube Saturation: Fender Twin 85W Vintage Verb Amp / Vox Vintage 15W Amp / Marshall 40W Tube Amp.</li>
              <li>Outboard Gear: 2ch VCA/Tube Compressor (Upgraded with balanced Jensen I/O Transformers) & 2ch 4 band EQ.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Mixing & Mastering</h4>
            <p>Since 2017 Dossas has been dedicating his life to training his ears, learning skills, and mastering his workflow to be the best possible engineer that he can be. From countless hours of seminars, master classes, and workshops to an entire year working under top engineers at Colorado Sound Recording LtdHe has been immersing himself in all things mix and master. He learned how to mix with an analog, all console workflow on a Neve 5088 console and knows Pro Tools software for the industry standard.</p>
            <p>There is no genre or audio source that Dossas won’t be able to work with. He is capable of mixing down ambisonic, dolby atmos and regular stereo or mono recordings. Currently He is in the process of creating a monitoring room for mixing in dolby atmos, but still the software and skills are there to handle any number of channel formats. </p>
            <p>Dossas currently uses three DAW’s, FL Studio 20, Pro Tools 12 and Ableton Live 11. He will add presonus studio to the list in 2023. </p>

            <p>He prefers to mix with his hybrid workflow at home with his project studio,  but if the client prefers, he’s able to do an all digital mix  “in-the-box” at his project studio, or work as a work-for-hire engineer at a different studio with a 24 ch. console or bigger.</p>

            <h4>Producing</h4>
            <p>Dossas has been playing piano ever since he was old enough to remember so being able to hear harmonies and melodies comes very naturally to him. He loves improvising on piano playing original songs on the fly in a classical pop style, as well as new wave jazz styles. He makes his own meditation and lofi beats as well as some EDM / Alternative Electronic Rock songs. Whenever there’s free time, you can find Dossas creating something new.</p>
            <p>He likes collaborating with different kinds of artists as long as their main intention is to harness the power of music and are willing to put 100% of their energy into their vocal and or instrumental performances. His specialties are EDM, R&B, Pop, and Rock. The emotional energy is everything so he prefers to work with artists who aren't afraid to get emotional. Also, since he’s emotionally intelligent, he’s able to feel out what the artist wants in order to help execute their creative vision. With the help of reference tracks, good communication and some emotional energy, Dossas will definitely be able to help you produce a demo and get your song idea to the next step.</p>
            <p>He really enjoys composing music and scores for video games and film as well as producing so as more opportunities present themselves in that field, Dossas wants to showcase his musical talent and creative vision. There’s so much that goes into putting a motion picture film or game together and he really appreciates the team effort that goes into something like that. When there’s good sound design, clean audio and beautiful background music, the visuals work better because the sound helps to create a cohesive environment. It’s a privilege being able to help a team of developers, engineers and producers master their vision and it’s on such a big scale so it’s a very rewarding area to put his skills towards. </p>
